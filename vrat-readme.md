# VRAT: Virtual Reality Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains the various modules of VRAT (Virtual Reality Analysis Toolkit), a comprehensive suite designed to assist researchers in conducting behavioral studies using cognitive architectures in virtual reality environments. VRAT supports four key stages of the research process:

## 1. Design

VRAT allows researchers to seamlessly transition their conventional 2D experiments into immersive VR environments.

- **Quick Setup**: Download the latest release and run the application to instantly transform your 2D experiment into VR.
- **Compatibility**: Works with a wide range of existing experimental paradigms.

## 2. Data Collection

VRAT environments are equipped with advanced data collection features to enhance your research capabilities.

- **Automatic Eye Tracking**: Built-in functionality to track and record participants' eye movements.
- **TCP Connectivity**: Connect VRAT to your custom programs for specialized tasks.
  - IP Address: `127.0.0.1`
  - Port: `6554`

## 3. Analysis

VRAT provides tools to help you visualize and analyze the collected data.

- **Eye-Tracking Visualization**: Specialized tools for visualizing eye-tracking data in 2D-to-VR experiments.
- **Custom Analysis**: Modify the `VideoRecorder.py` script to tailor the analysis to your specific needs and directory structure.

## 4. Modeling

Extend your VR experiments beyond VRAT's native capabilities with SteamVR integration.

- **SteamVR Driver**: Custom driver enabling interaction with SteamVR-compatible applications.
- **HTC Vive Compatibility**: Specifically designed to work with HTC Vive hardware.
- **Installation**: Upload the provided driver file to your SteamVR null driver directory.

## Getting Started

1. Download the latest VRAT release from the [Releases](link-to-releases) page.
2. Install and run the VRAT application.
3. Configure your experiment parameters within the VRAT interface.
4. Connect any additional hardware (e.g., eye-tracking devices) as needed.
5. Begin your VR experiment!
